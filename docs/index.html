        <h1>COVID-19 Québec Vaccine Tracker</h1> 
        <h2>Note. As of 14 Jan., the Québec government has moved the vaccination counts to a different website (now <a href="https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/situation-coronavirus-in-quebec/covid-19-vaccination-data/" target="_blank">here</a>). The team will update this website as soon as we have time (we are busy with grad school applications at the moment) to reflect this new data source.</h2>

Note. Our cumulative count differs from Québec's website since on 3 January 2021, the cumulative count decreased from to 29,250 to 28,762. Since there has been no explanation for this (none of the daily counts have been adjusted), we believe that our count is correct.</div>
